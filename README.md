# WikIKEA

![](html/logo.png)

The Free Wiki to build yourself at home. The website is available at <a href="https://webalorn.github.io/wikikea">webalorn.github.io/wikikea</a>, with all the instructions to make your own version. As I think there is no need for more explanations because instruction images are very clear, there won't be any in this readme :).
