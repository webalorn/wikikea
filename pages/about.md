WikIKEA is the ultimate easy-to-build-yourself wiki system! This version was provided to you by <a href="https://github.com/{{github_username}}">{{github_username}}</a>.

This project is inspired by the Netherlands-based furniture seller <a href="https://www.ikea.com/">IKEA</a> (selling things like shelves), and the encyclopedia known as <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> (well known to not be able to be put on shelves sold by IKEA, mainly because it does not consist of books).

The logo is inspired by the IKEA logo and the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg">Wikipedia logo</a>, uses the <a href="https://www.dafontfree.co/fat-sans-round-font/">Fat Sans Round Font</a>. The instructions images are created by <a href="https://github.com/webalorn">webalorn</a>, using images from <a href="https://idea-instructions.com/">IDEA</a> (CC by-nc-sa 4.0) and <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">thenounproject</a> (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0). The website design is loosely inspired by the Wikipedia website design.

The website itself and its code are made by <a href="https://github.com/webalorn">webalorn</a> and are available under <a href="https://github.com/webalorn/wikikea/blob/main/LICENSE">the MIT licence</a>.
